**App Description: Multi-Currency Exchange Rate Calculator with Historical Graphs**
This app allows users to view and calculate the exchange rates between two currencies (target currencies) using a third currency (base currency) as a reference point. By converting the two target currencies into the base currency first, it provides an accurate exchange rate between them.
The app not only calculates exchange rates between two currencies based on a third "base" currency but also includes a dynamic graph view. This graph allows users to visually compare exchange rate trends over time, either using a selected base currency as a reference or directly comparing the two target currencies without a base.

### Key Features:
1. **Base Currency Conversion**: Choose a base currency (e.g., USD) to calculate exchange rates between two target currencies (e.g., PEN to COP) through the intermediary currency.
2. **Direct Currency Comparison**: Option to compare exchange rates directly between two currencies without using a base currency, for a more straightforward view.
3. **Interactive Graph View**: 
   - The app displays a graph showing the historical trends of the exchange rate over a selected period (e.g., days, weeks, months, or years).
   - Users can switch between viewing rates based on the selected base currency or a direct comparison between the two target currencies.
   - The graph provides insights into fluctuations, making it easy to spot trends, peak rates, and dips over time.
4. **Real-Time and Historical Data**: The graph is updated with the latest exchange rates, and users can view historical data to understand past trends.
5. **Customizable Time Range**: Select different time ranges (e.g., last 30 days, 6 months, 1 year) to analyze short-term and long-term trends.
6. **Flexible Currency Selection**: Easily switch between different currencies to compare various pairs, with or without a base currency.

### How It Works:
1. **Select the Currencies**: Choose the two target currencies (e.g., PEN and COP) and optionally select a base currency (e.g., USD).
2. **Toggle Between Views**: The graph can be toggled to show:
   - **Base Currency View**: Displays historical rates based on the intermediary (base) currency.
   - **Direct Comparison View**: Shows the direct exchange rate history between the two target currencies without a base.
3. **Analyze the Data**: Use the interactive graph to explore trends, zoom in for more details, and switch between time ranges to get a comprehensive understanding of the exchange rate movements.

### Example Use Case:
If a user wants to compare the exchange rate of PEN to COP over the last six months:
   - With USD as the base currency, the graph shows how the PEN to USD and USD to COP rates impacted the overall conversion.
   - In the direct comparison view, the graph displays the historical rate between PEN and COP without using a base, providing a clear view of the trend.

This appâ€™s graph feature adds an extra layer of insight, helping users make informed decisions by understanding how exchange rates evolve over time, whether through a base currency or direct comparison.
